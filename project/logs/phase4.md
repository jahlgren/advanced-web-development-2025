# Project phase 4 - Basic structure and main functionalities

## ‚è±Ô∏è Project Title: Clockwork

## üìù Project Overview

**Clockwork** is a simple and intuitive time tracking web app designed for freelancers, teams, and anyone who wants to stay on top of how they spend their time across multiple projects.

Users can create and manage individual projects, then break down their work into custom categories (like design, development, meetings, etc.) and log hours accordingly. The goal is to give users clear insights into where their time goes, which helps with productivity, billing, and better planning.

## üìå Use Case Summary

Below is a summary of all use cases, including those planned during the initial phase and additional ones implemented during development. **All of the following features are implemented and working.**

**\* Additional implemented features.**

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical Implementation

- **Framework:** Built with Next.js (used for both frontend and backend via API routes).
- **Backend Runtime:** Runs as a Node.js server via Next.js.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM for type-safe, developer-friendly database interactions.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive design.
- **UI Components:** Shadcn UI for accessible, reusable interface elements.
- **Icons:** Lucide React for lightweight, consistent iconography.
- **Charts:** Recharts to visualize category-based time tracking.
- **Form Validation:** Zod for robust schema validation (used on both frontend and backend).
- **Notifications:** Sonner for toast feedback on user actions.
- **Data Management:** React Query for efficient server-state handling (caching, refetching, error handling).


## üöÄ Deployment & Hosting

Deployed as a Node.js app and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. Due to cost-saving measures, the container may not be running at all times and might be started only when needed. This means the application could experience some downtime when the container is not running.

The app is available here:

[http://ec2-13-60-203-139.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000](http://ec2-13-60-203-139.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/)

## üöÇ Development Process

The project began with a brainstorming phase to identify a realistic and meaningful app idea within a limited timeline. A time tracking application was chosen for its clear scope and practical utility.

Next.js was selected early on due to its ability to seamlessly combine frontend and backend in a single framework, along with its simple routing and developer-friendly experience.

Development started with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focused on core use cases like user authentication, project creation, and time logging. Once the MVP was complete, additional features, such as category management, time analytics, and live tracking were added incrementally as time allowed.

The development process went smoothly, with continuous testing and improvement throughout.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and Future Work

Overall, the development process went smoothly with minimal technical issues. The main challenges were staying motivated and managing the limited timeline.

While the core functionality was completed successfully, there are several areas where the app could be expanded and improved. Future enhancements could include:

- **Search and filtering**: Ability to search past timelogs by category and filter between specific date ranges.
- **Improved analytics**: More detailed reports and visual breakdowns of time usage.
- **User experience**: Further polish to the UI/UX for smoother navigation and feedback.
